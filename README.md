Group messaging platform

The objective is to develop a project in which multiple people can communicate with
each other. Essentially, we want to develop a tool where people would be able to
respond to each other and individually message each other. The entire purpose of a
group chat platform would be to share information with several people while being
organized. Besides sharing information, communication would be another reason
why group chat platforms are prevalent in our modern-day society. Having a well-developed
group chat platform would benefit people from industrial companies down to the average person.
